                <h1>Who am I ?</h1>
                <p>My name is Rafael, I'm a brazilian living abroad since 2018.</br>
                    I have a bachelor in business administration an MBA in market managmnet.
                    In 2017 I traveled for the first time to Europe and fall in love with all the different cultures and places that I visited.</br>
                    I decided then to move and begin a new life, and that's when I moved to Barcelona - Spain first.</br>
                    I learned Spanish and tought about doing another course in digital market, but since I wasn't working during the 6 months I was there I decided to move to Ireland to improve my english and return part of the investment I've made.</br>
                    In Ireland I started working in pubs and later as a security for pubs, nightclubs and events.</br>
                    Then 2020 happend, and with that an opportunity to do something that I had tried in Spain but end up given up, I started studying a programing language (JavaScript).</br>
                    I've always enjoyed this world of coding and programing but I always tought that I should have started early, and that it was impossible.</br>
                    Even thought <!-- <span> my husband and </span>  --> I decided to try and since jun/2020 I'm studying as a self-taught programmer everything related to HTML, CSS and Javascript.</br>
                    I've made some projects for beginers and intermediate and I'm in love with this world.</br>
                    My goal is to be able to work in a company as a softwear developer and improve my knolodge even more.
